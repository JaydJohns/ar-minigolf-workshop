## üé§ Script & Talking Points

### Opening (2 minutes)

**"Welcome! Today you're going to design a mini-golf course using augmented reality!"**

**Show the website on screen:**
- "This is what you'll be using"
- "It works on any phone or computer"
- "No app to download, no account needed"

**Ask:** "Who's played mini-golf before?"
**Ask:** "Who's used AR - like Snapchat filters or Pokemon GO?"

### Demo (3 minutes)

**Pick one obstacle and demonstrate:**
1. Click "Straight Ramp" button (it turns green)
2. Click on green surface to place it
3. Click the object to select it (glows yellow)
4. Show size slider - "Make it bigger or smaller"
5. Show rotation slider - "Spin it around"
6. Show height slider - "Lift it up"

**"Your mission: Design ONE hole of a mini-golf course"**

**Game Design Challenge:**
- "Make it fun but fair"
- "Think about how the ball would move"
- "Be creative - windmills spin, obstacles move!"
- "Use 5-8 different obstacles"

---

## üë• Group Assignment (3 minutes)

### Formation:
"Count off by 4s... all 1s over here, all 2s here..." (or your preferred method)

### Get Started:
1. Each group gets a QR code or URL
2. One student (or group device) opens the website
3. **IMPORTANT:** Click your group number button at the top!
   - Group 1 clicks "Group 1"
   - Group 2 clicks "Group 2"
   - etc.

**Why?** "Each group has their own workspace. Only click your group number!"

---

## üèóÔ∏è Design Time (15 minutes)

### Circulate and Guide:

**Encourage experimentation:**
- "Try the windmill - it spins automatically!"
- "What if you make that ramp bigger?"
- "How would the ball get through that?"

**If stuck:**
- "Start simple - place a ramp and a wall"
- "Think about the ball's path from START to HOLE"
- "Look at what other groups are doing"

**Challenge advanced groups:**
- "Can you create a trick shot?"
- "Make it harder without making it impossible"
- "Add a moving obstacle in the path"

**Common issues:**
- Can't place objects? ‚Üí "Click an obstacle button first"
- Wrong spot? ‚Üí "Click it to select, then click Delete Selected"
- Objects disappeared? ‚Üí "Make sure you're on your group number!"

## üö∂ Gallery Walk (5 minutes)

**"Let's see what everyone created!"**

### Instructions:
1. "Stay at your device"
2. "I'll call out group numbers to switch to"
3. "Click the group button at the top to see their course"

### Call out sequence:
- "Everyone switch to Group 1... look at this!"
- "Now Group 2... interesting obstacles!"
- "Group 3... wow, creative!"
- "Finally Group 4... nice work!"

### Discussion while viewing:
- "What do you notice about this design?"
- "What would make this challenging?"
- "Which obstacle is most creative?"

### Optional: Quick Vote
- "Raise hands - which hole looks hardest?"
- "Which is most creative?"
- "Which would you most want to play?"

---

## üëì AR Demo (Optional - 2 minutes)

**If you have an AR-capable device:**

1. Pick one group's course
2. Click "View in AR"
3. Allow camera access
4. Point at floor or table
5. **"See how it appears in real space!"**

**Note:** This is a bonus feature. Don't stress if AR doesn't work perfectly - the 3D builder is the main activity.

---

## üí¨ Wrap-Up Discussion (3 minutes)

### Questions to ask:

**Game Design:**
- "What was hardest about designing your hole?"
- "How is designing different from playing?"
- "What would you change if you could test it with a real ball?"

**Technology:**
- "Who had used 3D design tools before? Was this easier or harder?"
- "Where else could AR be useful?"
  - Architecture (visualize buildings)
  - Medicine (practice surgery)
  - Shopping (see furniture in your room)
  - Education (explore the solar system)

**Careers:**
- "This is what game designers and level designers do!"
- "AR developers create apps like this"
- "3D artists make the models"
- "Computer scientists write the code"

### Closing:
**"You just learned:**
- 3D spatial design
- Game balance and difficulty
- Collaborative problem-solving
- How AR technology works"

**"Want to learn more? The README file has links to free courses in game design and 3D programming!"**

## üÜò Emergency Troubleshooting

### Website won't load:
- **Backup:** Open the HTML file directly from your laptop (works offline!)
- Check WiFi - have students disconnect from other networks
- Use mobile hotspot if needed

### Students fighting over device:
- "One person is the clicker, others are the designers"
- "Take turns placing objects"
- "Discuss before clicking"

### Some students dominating:
- "Everyone must place at least one obstacle"
- "Make it democratic - vote on each placement"

### Finishing too early:
- "Redesign it - make it more challenging"
- "Try making it easier for younger kids"
- "Explore other groups' courses"
- "Try AR mode"

### Taking too long:
- "You have 2 minutes - add your final obstacles"
- Skip gallery walk, just project 2-3 courses
- Do quick voting from seats

---

## üì∏ Photo Opportunities

Great moments to capture:
- Students collaborating around a device
- Projected courses on screen during gallery walk
- AR view (if working) showing course in real space
- Student pointing at screen explaining their design
- Groups celebrating their completed course

---

## üéÅ Extensions & Follow-ups

**If students loved it:**

### Same class period:
- "Now redesign with a theme" (space golf, underwater golf, etc.)
- "Make a course for little kids vs. experts"
- Have groups trade and redesign each other's courses

### Future lessons:
- Teach basic A-Frame code (show them the HTML)
- Add scoring system
- Create ball physics
- Design entirely new games

### Take-home:
- Share the GitHub URL
- They can access from home
- Encourage them to show families

## üìä Assessment Ideas

**Informal assessment:**
- Did students collaborate effectively?
- Did they iterate and improve their design?
- Can they explain their design choices?
- Did they engage with game design concepts?

**Reflection questions (oral or written):**
1. "What game design principle did you learn?"
2. "How would you improve your course?"
3. "What was most challenging about this activity?"
4. "How could AR be used in your favorite hobby?"

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Management Tips

**Running behind?**
- Skip AR demo
- Shorten gallery walk (show 2 groups instead of 4)
- Cut discussion to 1-2 quick questions

**Ahead of schedule?**
- Deeper game design discussion
- Let groups refine their courses
- Show the HTML code (for advanced students)
- Demonstrate editing the code live

**Perfect timing?**
- Stick to the script above!

---

## üéâ Have Fun!

Remember: The goal is to spark interest in CS, game design, and AR technology. If students are engaged, collaborating, and excited - you're winning! Don't stress about perfection.

**You've got this! üöÄ**
