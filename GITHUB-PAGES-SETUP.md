## Troubleshooting

### "My page shows a 404 error"

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure the file is named `index.html` (not `ar-minigolf-creator.html`)
2. Wait 3-5 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
3. Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check that your repository is set to "Public"
5. Make sure you selected "main" branch in Pages settings

### "The page loads but looks broken"

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you uploaded the complete HTML file
2. Check that nothing was cut off during upload
3. Try uploading again
4. Test in a different browser

### "I can't find the Settings tab"

**You need to be:**
- Logged in to GitHub
- In YOUR repository (not someone else's)
- Check you're looking at the repository page (not your profile)

### "It works on computer but not on phone"

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure phone browser is up to date
2. Try Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS
3. Some features may not work on very old phones
4. AR mode requires newer phones with AR support

### "Students can't access the website"

**Solutions:**
1. Check your WiFi connection
2. Have students try mobile data if available
3. Double-check the URL (typos are common!)
4. Make sure repository is "Public"

## Making Changes After Upload

Want to update the website after it's live?

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click on `index.html`**
3. **Click the pencil icon** (Edit this file)
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Scroll down and click "Commit changes"**
6. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for changes to appear on your live site

## Backup Plan (If GitHub Pages Fails)

If you can't get GitHub Pages working before the workshop:

1. **Open the HTML file directly:**
   - Double-click `ar-minigolf-creator.html` on your computer
   - It will open in your browser
   - Works offline!

2. **Share via USB or AirDrop:**
   - Copy file to student devices
   - They can open it locally

3. **Use your laptop:**
   - Project your screen
   - Groups take turns using your laptop
   - Less ideal but still works!

## Privacy & Safety

**Good news:**
- No student data is collected
- No accounts required
- No personal information stored
- Everything runs in the browser
- Safe for educational use

---

## After the Workshop

**Keep the website online:**
